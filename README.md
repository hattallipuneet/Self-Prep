# Self-Prep


1. Implementing Runnable over extending Thread(from composition over inheritance perspective)
Synchronized collections vs concurrent collections(how they work/difference/when should we chose one over other)
2. Lock interface and ReentrantLock, ReentrantReadWriteLock
3. Atleast three common synchronizers (Semaphore, CountDownlatch, CyclicBarrier) usage/when to use one over another etc.
4. Synchronized context/Deadlock/Live Lock
5. Synchronized vs ReentrantLock
6. Thread pool, Executor Framework(at least fixed thread pool and cached thread pool), ExecutionCompletionService when to use one over another, submit method and execute method etc.
7. Callable/Runnable
8. Volatile variable and how it works during double checking case of Singletone implementation
9. Thread Local
10. Thread life cycle methods ( atleast start/run/wait/notify/notifyall/sleep/yield)
11. race condition
12. Producer consumer problem
13. Interrupting a thread
14. Thread dump
15. Immutable objects

<h3>Some advanced Topics</h3>

1. Stop a thread
2. Busy spin
3. Work steel algorithm and Fork Join framework
4. user thread/Demon Thread (like System.exit from both etc.)
5. Exception in Thread

<h3>Very advanced topics</h3>

1. Java memory Model(happens before rule etc.)
2. The Disruptor Framework
