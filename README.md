# Self-Prep


Implementing Runnable over extending Thread(from composition over inheritance perspective)

Synchronized collections vs concurrent collections(how they work/difference/when should we chose one over other)

Lock interface and ReentrantLock, ReentrantReadWriteLock

Atleast three common synchronizers (Semaphore, CountDownlatch, CyclicBarrier) usage/when to use one over another etc.

Synchronized context/Deadlock/Live Lock

Synchronized vs ReentrantLock

Thread pool, Executor Framework(at least fixed thread pool and cached thread pool), ExecutionCompletionService when to use one over another, submit method and execute method etc.

Callable/Runnable

Volatile variable and how it works during double checking case of Singletone implementation

Thread Local

Thread life cycle methods ( atleast start/run/wait/notify/notifyall/sleep/yield)

race condition

Producer consumer problem

Interrupting a thread

Thread dump
